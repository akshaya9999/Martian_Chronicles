## 😊 My Experience
This entire project helped me get familiar with PyQt designer and PyQt in general . My experience from doing 'Automate The Boring Stuff With Python' also helped in implementing the functionalities of the application, especially with the modules shutil, requests, os, ezgmail and pathlib.
I was also able to learn few of the widgets in PyQt5.
Overall this project was a great opportunity for me to learn and I hope that my efforts will be taken into consideration and I will be able to join the club.
